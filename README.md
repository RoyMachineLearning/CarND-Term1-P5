# Vehicle Detection for Self-Driving Cars

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project (#5 in Udacity's SDCND) I develop a pipeline to detect other vehicles on the road from images taken within a driving vehicle. Both machine leaning and computer vision techniques are utilized. The pipeline processes single images but can also be applied to frames of a video.

If you want to toy with the code, it's all in [pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/SealedSaint/CarND-Term1-P5/blob/master/pipeline.ipynb). The code is well-documented and there's lots of supporting text to walk you through the notebook. [Make sure you get all the dependencies installed. My repo of [Udacity's starter](https://github.com/SealedSaint/CarND-Term1-Starter) might help.]
